**Historical Gold Prices Comparison Using Various Regression Methods and Test**

A Data Mining and Visualization project using four regression methods, which are the Linear Model Regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, and the Ridge Regression model to predict the price of gold, based on the date, volume, and the open and close price of gold between the year 2000-2022.

According to this study's experimental result, we concluded that the best regression method among the four regression methods used is the Lasso Regression Method. This paper can be further developed and simulated for the comparison of the globalâ€™s monetary crisis. Future works can be pursued to identify the fluctuation rate of gold mining, stocks market returns, and inflationary.
